title: Creating a certificate

We made the field values in [sample_unsigned_cert.json](sample_unsigned_cert.json) as descriptive as possible to
help serve as an example starting point. For the full schema, see the [cert-schema docs](http://cert-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The base64 images are as follows:

- certificate.image: image of the actual certificate you are issuing
- issuer.image: issuer's logo
- assertion.image:signature: image of issuer's signature (i.e. handwriting)

We used png format for all images. These tools were helpful for creating sample badges and converting to/from base64:
