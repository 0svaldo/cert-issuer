Welcome to cert-issuer's documentation
======================================
The cert-issuer project issues digital certificates by creating a transaction from the issuing institution to the
recipient on the Bitcoin blockchain that includes the hash of the certificate itself. `See the schema <https://github.com/digital-certificates/cert-schema>`_
