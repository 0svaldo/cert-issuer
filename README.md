# Digital Certificates Project

### Setting Up The VM 
1. Install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Make a Linux VM (768MB of memory)
	* Make virtual harddisk (8GB) of VDI (Virtual Disk Image)
	* Select dynamically allocated memory
	* Download the .dmg file for Ubuntu [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
	* Install Ubuntu on the VM by clicking the .dmg file and clicking through the install steps
7. Install Github `sudo apt-get install git`
8. Install pip `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
9. Install python-dev `sudo apt-get install python-dev`
9. Install virtualenv `sudo pip install virtualenv`

### Setting Up The Blockchain Addresses
1. Make a [blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info) wallet and designate an address that will store your bitcoin for issuing the certificates. This is not the same as your issuing address, which you should NOT add to your wallet. Transfer a few BTC to this address. FYI: This will be referenced as your `STORAGE_ADDRESS` in the code.
2. Verify your blockchain.info account via the link in your email.
3. Enable the blockchain.info API to access your wallet [Account Settings > IP Restrictions > Enable API Access]
4. Go to [bitaddress.org](http://bitaddress.org) and create two address, the issuing address and the revocation address. Print these out to save them. 
5. Save the unencrypted private key for the issuing address to a USB. Do not plug in this USB when your computer's wifi is on. FYI: These will be referenced as your `ISSUING_ADDRESS` and `REVOCATION_ADDRESS` respectivly in the code.

### Install 
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ml-learning/digital-certificates-v2.git`
2. Create a Python 3 virtual environment: `cd digital-certificates-v2 && virtualenv venv -p python3.4`
3. Activate the virtual environment and install the requirements: `source venv/bin/activate && venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a secrets.py file: `nano secrets.py`

In the secrets.py file, place the following:

```
ISSUING_ADDRESS = "<issuing address>"
REVOCATION_ADDRESS = "<revocation address>"

USB_NAME = "<path to usb>"
KEYPATH = USB_NAME + "<name of private key file>"

WALLET_GUID = "<blockchain.info wallet guid>" # Your unique identifier to login to blockchain.info
WALLET_PASSWORD = "<blockchain.info wallet password>" # Your password to login to blockchain.info
STORAGE_ADDRESS = "<blockchain.info address with storage BTC>"
```

### To Run
1. Add your certificates to data/unsigned_certs/
2. Make sure you have enough BTC in your storage address. The amount needed is approximatly 0.10 cents (USD) per certificate. Or more accuratly, 0.0001 * number_certificates + 0.000255 BTC.
2. Run the create-certificates.py script to create your certificates: `python create-certificates.py`
